      Thank you for your input!  
      
      **Note**: Propably only people with the same device can help implementing the protocol for it. 
      That is why it is a good idea to try it yourself ðŸš€! Take a look at the tutorial in the [wiki](https://github.com/Sapd/HeadsetControl/wiki/Development)
      
      You can also upload WireShark logs, or ask for help in Coding and open up a PR any time.
